# React + Vite + Tailwind CSS Hackathon Project

This repository is the result of a hackathon by the team members of this GitHub repository. The goal of the hackathon was to recreate the following web template using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS within 6 hours: [Hiking Concept Web Template](https://www.freepik.com/free-psd/hiking-concept-web-template_7183405.htm#query=website%20templates&position=7&from_view=keyword&track=ais_user&uuid=05a833a8-9353-48bd-990e-e43a238d5ca4)

The project provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), some ESLint rules for code quality, and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.

Currently, two official plugins are used:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It's included in this setup for a more efficient and flexible styling approach.

Feel free to explore the code and see how we approached the challenge of recreating the web template.
